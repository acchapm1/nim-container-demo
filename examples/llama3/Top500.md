The HPC Top500 list ranks the world's fastest supercomputers. According to the list's archives, the supercomputer that has been at the top of the list the longest is:

* Summit (formerly known as Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Sierra), which held the top spot for 4 lists (June 2018 to November 2019), and then was surpassed by 
* Frontier (also at Oak Ridge National Laboratory), but before Summit, the top spot was held by 
* Sunway TaihuLight, which held the top spot for 3 lists (June 2016 to November 2017), but before that 
* Tianhe-2, which held the top spot for 5 lists (June 2013 to November 2015), and before that 
* ORNL's Jaguar (also known as Cray XT5), but before Jaguar 
* Roadrunner, which held the top spot for 3 lists (June 2008 to November 2009), but before Roadrunner 
* BlueGene/L, which held the top spot for 4 lists (November 2004 to June 2007) but the longest running top supercomputer in the HPC Top500 list was the 
* ASCI White, which held the top spot from November 2000 until June 2002 and then was tied for top spot for 1 more list (November 2002) and also the 
* Intel Paragon XP/S 140, but more notably 
* Connection Machine CM-5, but the longest running was the 
* Cray Y-MP/832, and then there is the 
* Cray-2, but the longest running #1 supercomputer in the HPC Top500 list was 
* Cray X-MP/48, but actually it was 
* Cray-1, and the one that holds the record of the most time at the #1 position is the 
* Cray-1 and its variants (Cray-1S and Cray-1M), which held the top spot for 7 lists (June 1979 to June 1985, with the exception of the November 1984 list), a record that has yet to be beaten, and it was also the first #1 supercomputer on the list.

However, if only the modern list (post 1993) is considered, then the longest running #1 supercomputer on the HPC Top500 list is 
* Tianhe-2, which held the top
